## Features ‚ú®

* **Real-Time Feedback**: The strength meter and criteria checklist update instantly with every keystroke.
* **Visual Strength Meter**: A color-coded progress bar visually represents the password's strength, changing from red (weak) to green (strong).
* **Dynamic Criteria Checklist**: A checklist details the requirements for a strong password and updates with a checkmark (‚úÖ) as each criterion is met.
* **Show/Hide Password**: A toggle button allows users to view or mask the password they are typing.
* **No Backend Needed**: The entire application runs on the client-side using vanilla JavaScript, making it fast and private.

## How Strength is Calculated

The password strength is evaluated based on a scoring system where one point is awarded for meeting each of the following five criteria:

1.  **Length**: At least 8 characters long.
2.  **Lowercase**: Contains at least one lowercase letter (`a-z`).
3.  **Uppercase**: Contains at least one uppercase letter (`A-Z`).
4.  **Numbers**: Contains at least one number (`0-9`).
5.  **Special Characters**: Contains at least one special character (e.g., `!@#$%^&*`).

The total score (0-5) corresponds to a strength level from "Very Weak" to "Very Strong".

## Technology Stack

* **HTML5**: Structures the web application.
* **CSS3**: Provides the modern, responsive, and dark-themed styling.
* **JavaScript (ES6)**: Powers all the logic, including event handling, DOM manipulation, and the strength calculation algorithm.
